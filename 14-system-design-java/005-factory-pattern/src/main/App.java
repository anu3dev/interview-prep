/**
 * Factory Pattern in Java-
 * 
 * The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface
 * for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type
 * of objects that will be created.
 * 
 * real world example is - In a logistics management system, a factory can be
 * used to create different types of transport vehicles (like Truck, Ship, 
 * Airplane) based on the delivery requirements.
 * 
 * Abstract Factory pattern in Java-
 * 
 * The Abstract Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an
 * interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without
 * specifying their concrete classes.
 * 
 * real world example is - In a cross-platform UI toolkit, an abstract factory
 * can be used to create UI components (like Buttons, TextFields, CheckBoxes)
 * for different operating systems (like Windows, macOS, Linux) without
 * specifying the exact classes of the components.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Factory - Let a subclass decide which specific object to create —
 * the parent just defines the method to “make” it.
 * It’s about creating one object from a family of similar types like circle / square from shape.
 * 
 * Abstract factory - Create factories of factories — each factory creates related sets of objects.
 * It’s about creating families of related objects without specifying their exact classes.
